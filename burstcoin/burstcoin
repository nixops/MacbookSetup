  How to burstcoin:


  Set up brew:

  https://brew.sh

  or execute this command in your terminal:

  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


  Now run the following in terminal:

  brew update && brew upgrade

  brew tap caskroom/versions

  brew cask install java8

  brew install mariadb

  mysql -u root -p

  In the mysql shell execute the following:

  CREATE DATABASE burstwallet;

  CREATE USER 'burstwallet'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password_you_choose'';

  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON burstwallet.* TO 'burstwallet'@'localhost’;

  exit

  Once completed run the following commands:

  cd ~/

  mkdir burstcoin && cd burstcoin

  wget https://github.com/PoC-Consortium/burstcoin/releases/download/2.2.1/burstcoin-2.2.1.zip

  unzip burstcoin-2.2.1.zip

  cd burstcoin-2-2.1

  chmod a+x burst.sh

  cp -rp conf/brs-default.properties conf/brs.properties

  echo "DB.Url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/burstwallet" >> conf/brs.properties

  echo "DB.Username=burstwallet" >> conf/brs.properties

  echo "DB.Password=$password_you_choose" >> conf/brs.properties

  Now we are ready to start, but we can also add an alias if you want please run following to be even lazier:

  echo "alias burstcoind='~/burstcoin/burst.sh'" >> ~/.bash_profile

  Now you will need to source in the profile:

  source ~/.bash_profile

  Now execute the following command:

  burstcoind

  This will be the command you can always use, if you chose not to use alias run the following command in your terminal:

  ~/burstcoin/burst.sh

  Paths may be slightly different but this is how i typically set it up on a mac :)

  ENJOY!
